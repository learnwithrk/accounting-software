## Example Walkthrough (End-to-End)

**Scenario:**
- Opening: T-Shirts M Red — 100 Nos @ ₹200 → ₹20,000
- Purchases: +300 Nos @ ₹190 → +₹57,000
- Sales/issues: −320 Nos

**Calculation:**
`Opening 100 + In 300 − Out 320 = Closing 80 Nos`
Avg cost: `(20,000 + 57,000) / 400 = ₹192.5`
Closing value: `80 × 192.5 = ₹15,400`

**Run sequence:**
- Stock Summary — check quantities and values
- Stock Item ledger — see voucher wise movement
- Movement Analysis — view monthly flows
- Stock Transfer Register — validate inter-location transfers
- Export item ledger for Excel-based MIS
