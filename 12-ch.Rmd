## Work with GST for Intra-State and Inter-State Supply of Goods

### Intra-State Supply (Within the Same State)

- Record sales/purchases with CGST and SGST components.
- In sales/purchase vouchers, select the customer/supplier with proper state information.
- Tally applies CGST and SGST tax rates automatically based on the state.
- Example: Sale to a customer in the same state attracts CGST 9% + SGST 9%.

### Inter-State Supply (Between Different States)

- Record sales/purchases attracting IGST instead of CGST+SGST.
- Tally calculates IGST based on the destination state.
- Example: Selling goods from Delhi to Maharashtra attracts IGST 18%.

---

## Recording Return of Goods (Credit/Debit Notes)

- To record return of goods, use **Credit Note** (for sales returns) or **Debit Note** (for purchase returns).
- Go to `Accounting Vouchers → Sales / Purchase menu → Credit/Debit Note`.
- Select party, enter quantities, rates, and tax details.
- Tally adjusts GST amounts accordingly.
