# Chart of Accounts: Groups & Ledgers

This chapter explains the structure of the **Chart of Accounts** in Tally Prime, and gives step-by-step procedures to create **Primary Groups**, **Sub-Groups**, and **Ledgers** (single and bulk). 

---

## Overview — Concepts

- **Group of Accounts**: A way to classify ledgers. Groups can be **Primary (root)** groups or **Sub-groups**.
- **Primary Group**: e.g., `Capital Account`, `Current Assets`, `Current Liabilities`, `Direct Expenses`.
- **Sub-Group**: Group under a primary group, e.g., `Sundry Creditors` under `Current Liabilities`.
- **Ledger**: Individual account (e.g., `Cash`, `Bank of India`, `Rent Expense`) that belongs to a group.

## Typical Group hierarchy (example)

| Level | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Primary Group | Current Assets |
| Sub-Group | Bank Accounts |
| Ledger | Bank of India - Current A/c |

### Creating a Primary Group (Step-by-step)

1. Open **Tally Prime** and go to **Gateway of Tally**.  
2. Select **Accounts Info.** → **Groups** → **Create**.  
3. In **Name**, type the group name, e.g., `Bank Accounts`.  
4. In **Under**, choose the parent group (for a primary top-level choose a suitable primary group, e.g., `Current Assets`).  
5. If required, set **Maintain balances bill-by-bill** or other group-specific features.  
6. Press **Ctrl + A** to accept and save.

**Example**

- Name: `Bank Accounts`  
- Under: `Current Assets`  
- Accept → Group saved.

### Creating a Sub-Group

Follow the *same* steps as Primary Group creation, but choose a different **Under** value.

**Example**

- Name: `Cash at Branch`  
- Under: `Bank Accounts` (the sub-group's parent)  
- Accept → Sub-group saved.

### Creating a Single Ledger (Step-by-step)

1. **Gateway of Tally** → **Accounts Info.** → **Ledgers** → **Create**.  
2. In **Name**, enter ledger name (e.g., `Cash in Hand - Chennai`).  
3. **Under** → choose the appropriate Group (e.g., `Cash-in-Hand` or `Bank Accounts`).  
4. Enter **Opening Balance** if required (e.g., `Dr 10,000`).  
5. Provide other fields as needed:
   - **Inventory values are affected**: Yes/No  
   - **Mailing details** (address, GSTIN) — if required for statutory ledgers  
6. Press **Ctrl + A** to save.

**Example**

- Name: `Cash in Hand - Chennai`  
- Under: `Cash-in-Hand` (Primary Group: `Current Assets`)  
- Opening Balance: `Dr 12,000`  
- Save.
