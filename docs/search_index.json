Groups can be Primary (root) groups or Sub-groups. Primary Group: e.g., Capital Account, Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Direct Expenses.

Ensure Inventory Features are enabled: Gateway of Tally → F11: Features → Inventory Features → Enable Inventory → Set required options (enable Batch/Expiry if needed). Backup your company before bulk changes (Alt + F3 → Backup). 6.1 Units of Measure (UOM) Units define how quantities are measured (Nos, Kg, Meter, Litre, Pack, Box). When to use: Use base UOM (e.g., Nos) for countable items; use alternate UOMs (e.g., Box = 12 Nos) for packaging/conversion. Steps to create a UOM: Gateway of Tally → Accounts Info / Inventory Info → Units of Measure → Create (may appear as: Gateway → Inventory Info → Units of Measure → Create) Unit Name: Enter e.g., Nos. Number of Units: Leave blank for simple unit. Choose “Unit Type”: Simple — Nos, Kg, etc. Compound — e.g., Box where 1 Box = 12 Nos. For compound UOM, specify conversion (e.g., 1 Box = 12 Nos). Press Ctrl + A to save. Examples: - Nos — simple unit for countable items - Kg — weight unit - Box — compound unit (1 Box = 12 Nos)  Tip: Decide base units early. Changing UOM after transactions is messy. 6.2 Stock Groups (Primary &amp; Multiple) Stock Groups classify stock items (Raw Materials, Finished Goods, Packing Materials). Structure example: - Primary: Raw Materials, Finished Goods, Packaging - Sub-group: Under Raw Materials → Chemicals, Components Steps to create a Stock Group: Gateway of Tally → Inventory Info → Stock Groups → Create Name: Enter group name (e.g., Raw Materials) Under: Choose parent (Primary for top-level) Set “Is the group a Primary group?” as required Save (Ctrl + A) Creating multiple stock groups: - Create one by one via Create screen - For many, prepare an import file (XML/TSV/CSV) with Name and Parent fields Example: - Finished Goods under Primary - Electronics under Finished Goods  Tip: Keep naming consistent and avoid long names for ease of voucher selection. 6.3 Stock Categories (Multiple) Stock Categories group items across attributes (Colour, Size, Brand). When to use: Manage variants (e.g., size/color) without separate items; for reporting/filtering. Steps to create Stock Category: Gateway of Tally → Inventory Info → Stock Categories → Create Name: e.g., Colour, Size, Brand Save (Ctrl + A) Create Category Values: 1. After creating category (e.g., Colour), create values (Red, Blue, Green): Inventory Info → Stock Categories → Alter (choose Colour) and define values Multiple categories usage: Apply categories per item (e.g., T-Shirt → Size: M, Colour: Blue, Brand: X).  Tip: If stock balances needed for each variant, create separate stock items or use Godowns/Batches. 6.4 Creating Stock Items (Single &amp; Multiple) Stock Items represent inventory transacted. Minimum required fields: - Name (unique) - Alias (optional) - Under (Stock Group) - Units (UOM) - Opening Balance (Qty and Value) - Rate/Price (optional) Single stock item — steps: Gateway of Tally → Inventory Info → Stock Items → Create Name: e.g., Widget A - Blue - M Alias: Optional short code Under: Choose stock group Unit: Nos, Kg, etc. Opening Balance: Enter qty and value (100 Nos @ ₹50 = ₹5000) Assign category values (if needed) Enter batch details if using Batch/Expiry Save (Ctrl + A) Bulk creation (multiple stock items): Option A — Tally Import (XML/TSV/CSV): Prepare CSV with columns: Name, Parent, UOM, OpeningQty, OpeningValue, Rate, Category1, Category2 In Tally: Gateway → Import of Data → Masters → select file and import; map columns. Option B — Excel → Save as XML / TSV: Check Tally help for template. Example entries: - Bag Leather Small (Finished Goods, Nos, 50, ₹12,500, ₹250) - Flour (Raw Materials, Kg, 200, ₹10,000, ₹50)  Tip: Use clear naming (Product - Variant - Size or Categories). Test import with 3–5 items before doing a full import. 6.5 Using Stock Categories &amp; Batches with Items You can associate category values and batch info with stock items for detailed inventory tracking. Example: Paracetamol 500mg → Batch001 Expiry 12/2026. View quantities per batch. 6.6 Verifying Inventory After Creation Display → Inventory Books → Stock Summary (stock balances by group and item) Display → Inventory Books → Stock Item (ledger for opening/closing qty) Display → Item-wise Details / Batch-wise Details Run Reports → Movement Analysis (stock issues/receipts pattern) 6.7 Example Walkthrough (End-to-End) 6.7.1 Scenario You sell T-shirts in sizes S, M, L and colors Red, Blue. You want to manage using Stock Groups, Units, Categories. 6.7.2 Steps Create UOM (Nos) Create Stock Groups: Finished Goods (Primary), Apparel (under Finished Goods) Create Stock Categories: Size (S, M, L) Colour (Red, Blue) Create Stock Items: Option A: Single item + select categories Option B: Separate item per variant (“T-Shirt - S - Red”) Enter opening qty/value for each (e.g., 50 Nos @ ₹200) Verify in Stock Summary and Item Ledgers 6.8 Common Pitfalls &amp; Troubleshooting UOM mismatch: E.g., item created with Box, used as Nos without conversion; causes errors. Wrong Stock Group: Items under wrong group distort reports; fix via Alter. Import errors: Incorrect column names, encoding (use UTF-8), wrong parent names. Use exact names. Batch/Expiry not enabled: Must enable before creating items.
