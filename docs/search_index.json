Groups help organize financial data systematically. group_of_accounts &lt;- list( Assets = c(“Cash”, “Bank”, “Accounts Receivable”), Liabilities = c(“Loans”, “Creditors”), Income = c(“Sales”, “Interest Received”), Expenses = c(“Salaries”, “Rent”) ) print(group_of_accounts) text 3.2 Pre-defined Group Pre-defined groups are standard categories used in accounting software or systems (like Tally). These include Assets, Liabilities, Income, and Expenses. predefined_groups &lt;- c(“Assets”, “Liabilities”, “Income”, “Expenses”) print(predefined_groups) text 3.3 Primary Group and Sub-Group Primary Group: Top-level categories (such as Assets, Expenses). Sub-Group: Sub-divisions within a primary group (e.g., ‘Current Assets’, ‘Direct Expenses’). groups &lt;- list( Assets = list(“Current Assets” = c(“Cash”, “Bank”), “Fixed Assets” = c(“Equipment”, “Real Estate”)), Expenses = list(“Direct Expenses” = c(“Raw Materials”), “Indirect Expenses” = c(“Rent”, “Utilities”)) ) print(groups) text 3.4 Ledger A ledger is an individual account within a group, representing a specific item (e.g., Cash account under Assets). Each ledger records all transactions related to that item. ledger_cash &lt;- list(name = “Cash”, group = “Current Assets”, balance = 15000) print(ledger_cash) text 3.5 Creation of Ledgers 3.5.1 Single Ledger Creation Create a single ledger by specifying its name, group, and opening balance. create_ledger &lt;- function(name, group, balance) { list(name = name, group = group, balance = balance) } ledger_salary &lt;- create_ledger(“Salary”, “Indirect Expenses”, 0) print(ledger_salary) text 3.5.2 Multiple Ledger Creation Create multiple ledgers by supplying vectors of names, groups, and balances. ledger_names &lt;- c(“Sales”, “Purchases”, “Bank”) ledger_groups &lt;- c(“Income”, “Expenses”, “Current Assets”) ledger_balances &lt;- c(50000, 30000, 15000) ledgers &lt;- mapply(create_ledger, ledger_names, ledger_groups, ledger_balances, SIMPLIFY = FALSE) print(ledgers) text 3.6 Addition, Alteration, and Deletion of Ledgers 3.6.1 Addition Add a new ledger to the existing list. add_ledger &lt;- function(ledgers, new_ledger) { c(ledgers, list(new_ledger)) } new_ledger &lt;- create_ledger(“Rent”, “Indirect Expenses”, 0) ledgers &lt;- add_ledger(ledgers, new_ledger) print(ledgers) text 3.6.2 Alteration Modify ledger properties (e.g., update balance). alter_ledger &lt;- function(ledger, new_balance) { ledger$balance &lt;- new_balance ledger } ledgers[] &lt;- alter_ledger(ledgers[], 60000) print(ledgers) text 3.6.3 Deletion Remove a ledger by its name. delete_ledger &lt;- function(ledgers, name) { ledgers[!sapply(ledgers, function(x) x$name == name)] } ledgers &lt;- delete_ledger(ledgers, “Bank”) print(ledgers) text Summary: Groups and ledgers form the backbone of accounting data organization.
