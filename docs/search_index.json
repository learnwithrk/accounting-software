Groups can be Primary (root) groups or Sub-groups. Primary Group: e.g., Capital Account, Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Direct Expenses.

Ensure Inventory Features are enabled: Gateway of Tally → F11: Features → Inventory Features → Enable Inventory → Set required options (enable Batch/Expiry if needed). Backup your company before bulk changes (Alt + F3 → Backup). 6.1 Units of Measure (UOM) Units define how quantities are measured (Nos, Kg, Meter, Litre, Pack, Box). When to use: Use base UOM (e.g., Nos) for countable items; use alternate UOMs (e.g., Box = 12 Nos) for packaging/conversion. Steps to create a UOM: Gateway of Tally → Accounts Info / Inventory Info → Units of Measure → Create (may appear as: Gateway → Inventory Info → Units of Measure → Create) Unit Name: Enter e.g., Nos. Number of Units: Leave blank for simple unit. Choose “Unit Type”: Simple — Nos, Kg, etc. Compound — e.g., Box where 1 Box = 12 Nos. For compound UOM, specify conversion (e.g., 1 Box = 12 Nos). Press Ctrl + A to save. Examples: - Nos — simple unit for countable items - Kg — weight unit - Box — compound unit (1 Box = 12 Nos)  Tip: Decide base units early. Changing UOM after transactions is messy. 6.2 Stock Groups (Primary &amp; Multiple) Stock Groups classify stock items (Raw Materials, Finished Goods, Packing Materials). Structure example: - Primary: Raw Materials, Finished Goods, Packaging - Sub-group: Under Raw Materials → Chemicals, Components Steps to create a Stock Group: Gateway of Tally → Inventory Info → Stock Groups → Create Name: Enter group name (e.g., Raw Materials) Under: Choose parent (Primary for top-level) Set “Is the group a Primary group?” as required Save (Ctrl + A) Creating multiple stock groups: - Create one by one via Create screen - For many, prepare an import file (XML/TSV/CSV) with Name and Parent fields Example: - Finished Goods under Primary - Electronics under Finished Goods  Tip: Keep naming consistent and avoid long names for ease of voucher selection. 6.3 Stock Categories (Multiple) Stock Categories group items across attributes (Colour, Size, Brand). When to use: Manage variants (e.g., size/color) without separate items; for reporting/filtering. Steps to create Stock Category: Gateway of Tally → Inventory Info → Stock Categories → Create Name: e.g., Colour, Size, Brand Save (Ctrl + A) Create Category Values: 1. After creating category (e.g., Colour), create values (Red, Blue, Green): Inventory Info → Stock Categories → Alter (choose Colour) and define values Multiple categories usage: Apply categories per item (e.g., T-Shirt → Size: M, Colour: Blue, Brand: X).  Tip: If stock balances needed for each variant, create separate stock items or use Godowns/Batches. 6.4 Creating Stock Items (Single &amp; Multiple) Stock Items represent inventory transacted. Minimum required fields: - Name (unique) - Alias (optional) - Under (Stock Group) - Units (UOM) - Opening Balance (Qty and Value) - Rate/Price (optional) Single stock item — steps: Gateway of Tally → Inventory Info → Stock Items → Create Name: e.g., Widget A - Blue - M Alias: Optional short code Under: Choose stock group Unit: Nos, Kg, etc. Opening Balance: Enter qty and value (100 Nos @ ₹50 = ₹5000) Assign category values (if needed) Enter batch details if using Batch/Expiry Save (Ctrl + A) Bulk creation (multiple stock items): Option A — Tally Import (XML/TSV/CSV): Prepare CSV with columns: Name, Parent, UOM, OpeningQty, OpeningValue, Rate, Category1, Category2 In Tally: Gateway → Import of Data → Masters → select file and import; map columns. Option B — Excel → Save as XML / TSV: Check Tally help for template. Example entries: - Bag Leather Small (Finished Goods, Nos, 50, ₹12,500, ₹250) - Flour (Raw Materials, Kg, 200, ₹10,000, ₹50)  Tip: Use clear naming (Product - Variant - Size or Categories). Test import with 3–5 items before doing a full import. 6.5 Using Stock Categories &amp; Batches with Items You can associate category values and batch info with stock items for detailed inventory tracking. Example: Paracetamol 500mg → Batch001 Expiry 12/2026. View quantities per batch. 6.6 Verifying Inventory After Creation Display → Inventory Books → Stock Summary (stock balances by group and item) Display → Inventory Books → Stock Item (ledger for opening/closing qty) Display → Item-wise Details / Batch-wise Details Run Reports → Movement Analysis (stock issues/receipts pattern) 6.7 Example Walkthrough (End-to-End) 6.7.1 Scenario You sell T-shirts in sizes S, M, L and colors Red, Blue. You want to manage using Stock Groups, Units, Categories. 6.7.2 Steps Create UOM (Nos) Create Stock Groups: Finished Goods (Primary), Apparel (under Finished Goods) Create Stock Categories: Size (S, M, L) Colour (Red, Blue) Create Stock Items: Option A: Single item + select categories Option B: Separate item per variant (“T-Shirt - S - Red”) Enter opening qty/value for each (e.g., 50 Nos @ ₹200) Verify in Stock Summary and Item Ledgers 6.8 Common Pitfalls &amp; Troubleshooting UOM mismatch: E.g., item created with Box, used as Nos without conversion; causes errors.

Batch/Expiry not enabled: Must enable before creating items. Duplicate item names: Tally allows duplicates with different aliases—avoid for accuracy. 6.9 Advanced: Godowns/Locations &amp; Stock Transfer Create Godowns via Inventory Info → Godowns (e.g., Main Warehouse, Shop1) Use Stock Journal/Transfer Voucher to move stock between Godowns Useful for multi-location tracking and reconciliation 6.10 Reports to Check Inventory Health Stock Summary — quantities &amp; values by group Movement Analysis / Receipts &amp; Issues — item flow Ageing Analysis (slow-moving items, if available) Stock Transfer Register — inter-godown transfers 6.11 Best Practices Decide naming conventions before data entry Use categories for variant management if supported; otherwise, create separate items per variant Maintain consistent UOMs Always backup before large imports or changes Keep master data clean for accurate MIS Run weekly stock summary and monthly reconciliation 6.12 Quick Reference — Common Menu Paths &amp; Shortcuts Inventory Features: F11 → Inventory Features Create UOM: Inventory Info → Units of Measure → Create Create Stock Group: Inventory Info → Stock Groups → Create Create Stock Category: Inventory Info → Stock Categories → Create Create Stock Item: Inventory Info → Stock Items → Create Stock Summary: Display → Inventory Books → Stock Summary Import Masters: Gateway of Tally → Import Data → Masters "],["inventory-vouchers-in-tally-prime-detailed-steps-examples.html", "7 Inventory Vouchers in Tally Prime — Detailed Steps &amp; Examples 7.1 Enabling Inventory Vouchers 7.2 Purchase Order (PO) 7.3 Sales Order 7.4 Material In 7.5 Material Out 7.6 Receipt Note 7.7 Delivery Note 7.8 Rejection In 7.9 Rejection Out 7.10 Stock Journal 7.11 Physical Stock Voucher 7.12 Summary Table", " 7 Inventory Vouchers in Tally Prime — Detailed Steps &amp; Examples Tally Prime provides several inventory vouchers for tracking the movement of goods from purchase to sale, physical verification, and stock adjustments.
