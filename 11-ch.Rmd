## General Tips & Troubleshooting

- Always check your date periods with `F2`—incorrect periods cause missing/misleading reports.
- For accurate analysis, ensure all vouchers (including non-cash) are properly recorded and classified.
- For Fund and Cash Flow, transfers between accounts (cash to bank, etc.) are not shown as business cash movement.
- Use export features for detailed audit and MIS.
