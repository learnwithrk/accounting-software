# Bank Reconciliation

Bank reconciliation matches company’s bank ledger entries with the bank’s statement.  
The result is a Reconciliation Statement showing:
- Items cleared (matched in both Tally and Bank)
- Outstanding items (not yet cleared)
- Bank balance per books vs bank balance per bank statement
- Reconciling items: cheques in transit, unpresented cheques, bank charges, direct credits

---

## Prerequisites

- Company selected and correct financial year opened
- Bank ledger(s) created (e.g., HDFC Bank - Current)
- Vouchers and bank transactions entered in Tally (payments, receipts, contra, charges)
- Bank statement received (Excel/CSV/PDF) for the period
- (Optional) If importing, prepare CSV: Date, Description, Debit, Credit, Reference

---

## Entering Bank Data in Tally

### Manual Entry

- Record all bank transactions using vouchers:
    - **Payments**: Payment Voucher (select bank ledger)
    - **Receipts**: Receipt Voucher (bank ledger as Dr)
    - **Contra**: For cash-bank transfers
    - **Bank Charges/Interest**: Payment voucher (bank ledger credited, expense/interest debited)

**Example Entries**
- 03-07-2025 — Cheque to Supplier XYZ — ₹15,000 (Payment voucher: Credit HDFC, Debit Creditors)
- 10-07-2025 — Customer RTGS receipt — ₹20,000 (Receipt voucher: Debit HDFC, Credit Debtors)
- 31-07-2025 — Bank charges ₹200 (Payment: Credit HDFC, Debit Bank Charges)

> 💡 **Tip:** Record cheque numbers and reference for easy matching.

## Open the Bank Reconciliation Screen

- Path: `Gateway of Tally → Display → Statements → Bank Reconciliation`
- or `Gateway → Accounting Vouchers → Bank Reconciliation`
- Choose the Bank Ledger (e.g., HDFC Bank - Current)
- Set period with `F2` (e.g., 01-07-2025 to 31-07-2025)
- Screen displays: bank statement lines (if imported), book entries, ability to mark “Reconciled”

---

## Matching / Marking Reconciled Entries

### Manual Reconciliation

- Match each bank statement line with the Tally voucher (amount, date, cheque/UTR/reference)
- Select both, mark as reconciled (key/button varies; Space/R/Match/Enter)
- Confirm reconciliation date (often bank statement date)
- Repeat for all cleared items

**Example**
- Bank shows RTGS ₹20,000, 10-07-2025, UTR123; Tally shows same receipt on same date. Mark both as reconciled.

### Handling Special Cases

- Amounts differ: record adjustment voucher for bank charge, reconcile difference
- Cheque bounced: don’t reconcile; create reversal voucher
- Unpresented cheques: leave as unreconciled—in future, clear when bank shows them

---

## Review Reconciled & Unreconciled Lists

- Filter to see:
    - **Reconciled Entries**: matched, with reconciliation date
    - **Unreconciled (Book)**: vouchers entered, not yet cleared in bank
    - **Unreconciled (Bank)**: bank statement entries not recorded in Tally

**How to view:**  
Within the Reconciliation screen, use F12/View to switch between lists.

**Example Output**
- Reconciled: Receipt ₹20,000 (10-07-2025), Payment ₹15,000 (03-07-2025)
- Unreconciled: Cheque payment ₹5,000 (27-07-2025, not yet cleared)
- Bank charges not in Tally: Bank charges ₹200 (31-07-2025)

---

## Creating/Reversing Vouchers for Bank Adjustments

- Bank charges/interest/direct credits: create vouchers in Tally (Payment for charges, Receipt for credits), then mark as reconciled
- Dishonour/bank debit errors: create reversal/adjusment vouchers

**Example**
- Bank debits ₹300 service charge (31-07-2025): Payment voucher — Debit Bank Charges ₹300, Credit HDFC ₹300

---

## Generate Reconciled Statement / Reconciliation Report

### Summary Statement

Shows:
- Balance as per Bank Statement (closing)
- Add: Deposits in transit
- Less: Unpresented cheques
- Adjusted bank balance (should match books)
- Balance as per Tally books

**Sample Bank Reconciliation Statement Format**

| Description                                   | Amount (₹)         |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Balance as per Bank Statement (closing)       | XXX                |
| Add: Deposits in transit                      | YYY                |
| Less: Unpresented Cheques                     | ZZZ                |
| **Adjusted Bank Balance**                     | XXX + YYY - ZZZ    |
| Balance as per Books (Bank Ledger Closing)    | AAA                |


If adjusted bank balance = book balance → reconciliation complete.

### Detailed Report

- Lists each reconciled/unreconciled item with status, reference, date, amount

**Print/Export**
- Alt+P: Print
- Alt+E: Export (PDF/Excel/CSV/Word)
- Use UTF-8 for CSV if needed

## Saving & Locking Reconciliation (Audit Trail)

- Save session; Tally records reconciliation date
- Some versions allow locking or audit notes—add narration for reconciling items
