## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

- **Voucher type missing**: Check **F11 → Features** and voucher configuration; some vouchers are hidden by default.  
- **Tax not calculated**: Ensure GST is enabled and tax ledgers are created and attached to item ledger.  
- **Cannot delete voucher**: User permissions or voucher linked to reports — use Reverse/Adjustment instead.  
- **Incorrect ledger chosen**: Undo (Ctrl+Z not always available) — use Voucher Alter to correct or create reversal voucher.
